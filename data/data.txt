This chapter reviews evidence for the evolution of primate asymmetries in brain morphology and in behaviour, including the fossil and archaeological record of human evolution. This evidence suggests that, while morphological asymmetries are conserved features of the human brain, human functional asymmetries are derived, at least in their degree and consistency. The discussion offers a partial explanation that takes account of allometric scaling in the evolution of brain size, neocortex size, and intra- and interhemispheric connectivity.

Improper Input Validation (IIV) is a software vulnerability that occurs when
a system does not safely handle input data. Even though IIV is easy to detect
and fix, it still commonly happens in practice. In this paper, we study to what
extent developers can detect IIV and investigate underlying reasons. This
knowledge is essential to better understand how to support developers in
creating secure software systems. We conduct an online experiment with 146
participants, of which 105 report at least three years of professional software
development experience. Our results show that the existence of a visible attack
scenario facilitates the detection of IIV vulnerabilities and that a
significant portion of developers who did not find the vulnerability initially
could identify it when warned about its existence. Yet, a total of 60
participants could not detect the vulnerability even after the warning. Other
factors, such as the frequency with which the participants perform code
reviews, influence the detection of IIV. Data and materials:

We correct what amounts to a sign error in the proof of part (i.) of theorem
3 in Class.Quant.Grav.28 225003 (arXiv:1107.0709). The Plebanski sectors
isolated by the linear simplicity constraints do not change --- they are still
the three sectors (deg), (II+), and (II-). What changes is the characterization
of the continuum Plebanski two-form corresponding to the first two terms in the
asymptotics of the EPRL vertex amplitude for Regge-like boundary data. These
two terms do not correspond to Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), but rather to
the two possible signs of the product of the sign of the sector --- +1 for
(II+) and -1 for (II-) --- and the sign of the orientation
$\epsilon_{IJKL}B^{IJ} \wedge B^{KL}$ determined by $B^{IJ}$. This is
consistent with what one would expect, as this is exactly the sign which
classically relates the BF action, in Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), to the
Einstein-Hilbert action, whose discretization is the Regge action appearing in
the asymptotics.

Intrinsic image decomposition is a challenging, long-standing computer vision
problem for which ground truth data is very difficult to acquire. We explore
the use of synthetic data for training CNN-based intrinsic image decomposition
models, then applying these learned models to real-world images. To that end,
we present \ICG, a new, large-scale dataset of physically-based rendered images
of scenes with full ground truth decompositions. The rendering process we use
is carefully designed to yield high-quality, realistic images, which we find to
be crucial for this problem domain. We also propose a new end-to-end training
method that learns better decompositions by leveraging \ICG, and optionally IIW
and SAW, two recent datasets of sparse annotations on real-world images.
Surprisingly, we find that a decomposition network trained solely on our
synthetic data outperforms the state-of-the-art on both IIW and SAW, and
performance improves even further when IIW and SAW data is added during
training. Our work demonstrates the suprising effectiveness of
carefully-rendered synthetic data for the intrinsic images task.

To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are
standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$
luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from
H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation
parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and
nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift
and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different
$L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly
distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow
different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample
containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it
could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better
understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.

The existing image steganography methods either sequentially conceal secret
images or conceal a concatenation of multiple images. In such ways, the
interference of information among multiple images will become increasingly
severe when the number of secret images becomes larger, thus restrict the
development of very large capacity image steganography. In this paper, we
propose an Invertible Mosaic Image Hiding Network (InvMIHNet) which realizes
very large capacity image steganography with high quality by concealing a
single mosaic secret image. InvMIHNet consists of an Invertible Image Rescaling
(IIR) module and an Invertible Image Hiding (IIH) module. The IIR module works
for downscaling the single mosaic secret image form by spatially splicing the
multiple secret images, and the IIH module then conceal this mosaic image under
the cover image. The proposed InvMIHNet successfully conceal and reveal up to
16 secret images with a small number of parameters and memory consumption.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO and DIV2K show InvMIHNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the imperceptibility of stego image
and recover accuracy of secret image.

We discuss four questions dealing with massive star evolution. The first one
is about the origin of slowly rotating, non-evolved, nitrogen rich stars. We
propose that these stars may originate from initially fast rotating stars whose
surface has been braked down. The second question is about the evolutionary
status of alpha-Cygni variables. According to their pulsation properties, these
stars should be post red supergiant stars. However, some stars at least present
surface abundances indicating that they should be pre red supergiant stars. How
to reconcile these two contradictory requirements? The third one concerns the
various supernova types which are the end point of the evolution of stars with
initial masses between 18 and 30 Msun, i.e. the most massive stars which go
through a red supergiant phase during their lifetime. Do they produce types
IIP, IIL, IIn, IIb or Ib supernovae or do they end without producing any SN
event? Finally, we shall discuss reasons why so few progenitors of type Ibc
supernovae have yet been detected?

We present early-time Swift and Chandra X-ray data along with late-time
optical and near-infrared observations of SN 2013by, a Type IIL supernova (SN)
that occurred in the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 138$-$G10 (D $\sim 14.8$ Mpc).
Optical and NIR photometry and spectroscopy follow the late-time evolution of
the supernova from days +89 to +457 post-maximum brightness. The optical
spectra and X-ray light curves are consistent with the picture of a SN having
prolonged interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) that accelerates the
transition from supernova to supernova remnant (SNR). Specifically, we find SN
2013by's H$\alpha$ profile exhibits significant broadening ($\sim$ 10,000 km
s$^{-1}$) on day +457, the likely consequence of high-velocity, H-rich material
being excited by a reverse shock. A relatively flat X-ray light curve is
observed that cannot be modeled using inverse-Compton scattering processes
alone but requires an additional energy source most likely originating from the
SN-CSM interaction. In addition, we see the first overtone of CO emission near
2.3 $\mu$m on day +152, signaling the formation of molecules and dust in the SN
ejecta and is the first time CO has been detected in a Type IIL supernova. We
compare SN 2013by to Type IIP supernovae whose spectra show the rarely observed
SN-to-SNR transition in varying degrees and conclude that Type IIL SNe may
enter the remnant phase at earlier epochs than their Type IIP counterparts.

In recent years, the quality and public interest in music generation systems
have grown, encouraging research into various ways to control these systems. We
propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using
sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous
Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived
musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be
calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of
surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in
irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose
IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that
the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The
correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for
estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if
human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when
generating the respective musical material. We provide code for creating IIC
interpolations and IIC visualizations on https://github.com/muthissar/iic.

Mobile crowdsourcing services (MCS), enable fast and economical data
acquisition at scale and find applications in a variety of domains. Prior work
has shown that Foursquare and Waze (a location-based and a navigation MCS) are
vulnerable to different kinds of data poisoning attacks. Such attacks can be
upsetting and even dangerous especially when they are used to inject improper
inputs to mislead users. However, to date, there is no comprehensive study on
the extent of improper input validation (IIV) vulnerabilities and the
feasibility of their exploits in MCSs across domains. In this work, we leverage
the fact that MCS interface with their participants through mobile apps to
design tools and new methodologies embodied in an end-to-end feedback-driven
analysis framework which we use to study 10 popular and previously unexplored
services in five different domains. Using our framework we send tens of
thousands of API requests with automatically generated input values to
characterize their IIV attack surface. Alarmingly, we found that most of them
(8/10) suffer from grave IIV vulnerabilities which allow an adversary to launch
data poisoning attacks at scale: 7400 spoofed API requests were successful in
faking online posts for robberies, gunshots, and other dangerous incidents,
faking fitness activities with supernatural speeds and distances among many
others. Lastly, we discuss easy to implement and deploy mitigation strategies
which can greatly reduce the IIV attack surface and argue for their use as a
necessary complementary measure working toward trustworthy mobile crowdsourcing
services.

Despite millions of war widows worldwide, little is known about the economic
consequences of being widowed by war. We use life history data from West
Germany to show that war widowhood increased women's employment immediately
after World War II but led to lower employment rates later in life. War widows,
therefore, carried a double burden of employment and childcare while their
children were young but left the workforce when their children reached
adulthood. We show that the design of compensation policies likely explains
this counterintuitive life-cycle pattern and examine potential spillovers to
the next generation.

Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is an under-constrained problem.
Therefore, traditional approaches use hand crafted priors to constrain the
problem. However, these constraints are limited when coping with complex
scenes. Deep learning-based approaches learn these constraints implicitly
through the data, but they often suffer from dataset biases (due to not being
able to include all possible imaging conditions).
  In this paper, a combination of the two is proposed. Component specific
priors like semantics and invariant features are exploited to obtain
semantically and physically plausible reflectance transitions. These
transitions are used to steer a progressive CNN with implicit homogeneity
constraints to decompose reflectance and shading maps.
  An ablation study is conducted showing that the use of the proposed priors
and progressive CNN increase the IID performance. State of the art performance
on both our proposed dataset and the standard real-world IIW dataset shows the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is made available at

Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP), which represent the most common class of
core-collapse (CC) SNe, show a rapid increase in continuum polarization just
after entering the tail phase. This feature can be explained by a highly
asymmetric helium core, which is exposed when the hydrogen envelope becomes
transparent. Here we report the case of a SN IIP (SN~2017gmr) that shows an
unusually early rise of the polarization, $\gtrsim 30$ days before the start of
the tail phase. This implies that SN~2017gmr is an SN IIP that has very
extended asphericity. The asymmetries are not confined to the helium core, but
reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope, hence clearly
indicating a marked intrinsic diversity in the aspherical structure of CC
explosions. These observations provide new constraints on the explosion
mechanism, where viable models must be able to produce such extended deviations
from spherical symmetry, and account for the observed geometrical diversity.

The first half of the 17th century was a time of intellectual ferment when
wars of natural philosophy were echoes of religious wars, as we illustrate by a
case study of an apparently innocuous mathematical technique called adequality
pioneered by the honorable judge Pierre de Fermat, its relation to
indivisibles, as well as to other hocus-pocus. Andre Weil noted that simple
applications of adequality involving polynomials can be treated purely
algebraically but more general problems like the cycloid curve cannot be so
treated and involve additional tools--leading the mathematician Fermat
potentially into troubled waters. Breger attacks Tannery for tampering with
Fermat's manuscript but it is Breger who tampers with Fermat's procedure by
moving all terms to the left-hand side so as to accord better with Breger's own
interpretation emphasizing the double root idea. We provide modern proxies for
Fermat's procedures in terms of relations of infinite proximity as well as the
standard part function.

Several Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) have been extensively studied, both in
terms of the progenitor radius and the mass-loss rate in the final centuries
before the explosion. While the sample is still limited, evidence has been
accumulating that the final mass-loss rate tends to be larger for a more
extended progenitor, with the difference exceeding an order of magnitude
between the more and less extended progenitors. The high mass-loss rates
inferred for the more extended progenitors are not readily explained by a
prescription commonly used for a single stellar wind. In this paper, we
calculate a grid of binary evolution models. We show that the observational
relation in the progenitor radii and mass-loss rates may be a consequence of
non-conservative mass transfer in the final phase of progenitor evolution
without fine tuning. Further, we find a possible link between SNe IIb and SNe
IIn. The binary scenario for SNe IIb inevitably leads to a population of SN
progenitors surrounded by dense circumstellar matter (CSM) due to extensive
mass loss ($\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in the binary
origin. About 4% of all observed SNe IIn are predicted to have dense CSM,
produced by binary non-conservative mass transfer, whose observed
characteristics are distinguishable from SNe IIn from other scenarios. Indeed,
such SNe may be observationally dominated by systems experiencing huge mass
loss in the final $10^3$ yr, leading to luminous SNe IIn or initially bright
SNe IIP or IIL with characteristics of SNe IIn in their early spectra.

Mediation analysis is appealing for its ability to improve understanding of
the mechanistic drivers of causal effects, but real-world data complexities
challenge its successful implementation, including: 1) the existence of
post-exposure variables that also affect mediators and outcomes (thus,
confounding the mediator-outcome relationship), that may also be 2)
multivariate, and 3) the existence of multivariate mediators. Interventional
direct and indirect effects (IDE/IIE) accommodate post-exposure variables that
confound the mediator-outcome relationship, but currently, no estimator for
IDE/IIE exists that allows for both multivariate mediators and multivariate
post-exposure intermediate confounders. This, again, represents a significant
limitation for real-world analyses. We address this gap by extending two
recently developed nonparametric estimators -- one that estimates the IDE/IIE
and another that estimates the IDE/IIE transported to a new, target population
-- to allow for multivariate mediators and multivariate intermediate
confounders simultaneously. We use simulation to examine finite sample
performance, and apply these estimators to longitudinal data from the Moving to
Opportunity trial. In the application, we walk through a strategy for
separating indirect effects into mediator- or mediator-group-specific indirect
effects, while appropriately accounting for other, possibly co-occurring
intermediate variables.

We show that the diversity in the density slope of the dense wind due to
non-steady mass loss can be one way to explain the spectral diversity of Type
II luminous supernovae (LSNe). The interaction of SN ejecta and wind
surrounding it is considered to be a power source to illuminate LSNe because
many LSNe show the wind signature in their spectra (Type IIn LSNe). However,
there also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type
IIL LSNe). We show that, even if LSNe are illuminated by the interaction, it is
possible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into
account of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout
takes place in the dense wind with the density structure \rho\propto r^{-w},
the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind
(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock
breakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w<~1, both timescales are
comparable (td/ts \simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the
case td/ts\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light
curve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed
after the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave
continues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains
(Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful
treatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow
Lorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be
explained by the difference in the density slope. Furthermore, we apply our
model to Type IIn LSN 2006gy and Type IIL LSN 2008es and find that our model is
consistent with the observations.

I explore a phenomenon of the circumstellar H alpha and H beta absorption
lines in the spectrum of luminous type IIL SN 2008fq taken on day 6.8 after the
discovery. The absorpion is identified with the radiatively accelerated
preshock wind up to ~800 km/s. The required initial luminosity is attributed to
the earlier circumstellar interaction with the confined dense shell of ~0.08
Msun. The modelling of similar luminous type IIL SN 1998S based on the same
approach results in the comparable shell mass of ~0.1 Msun. More than 1 dex
larger mass of the confined dense shell of both SNe IIL compared to that of
type IIP supernovae is attributed to the larger progenitor mass of type IIL
supernovae.

Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms
remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced
an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based
on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI
involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve
stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the
presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling
choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse
engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many
desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio,
requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure
stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not
satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI
system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs,
particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly
localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we
devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired
by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized
velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of
structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering
the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of
the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic
conditions, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution.

Tadeusz Cali\'{n}ski was born in Pozna\'{n}, Poland in 1928. Despite the
absence of formal secondary eduction for Poles during the Second World War, he
entered the University of Pozna\'{n} in 1948, initially studying agronomy and
in later years mathematics. From 1953 to 1988 he taught statistics, biometry
and experimental design at the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}. During
this period he founded and developed the Pozna\'{n} inter-university school of
mathematical statistics and biometry, which has become one of the most
important schools of this type in Poland and beyond. He has supervised 24 Ph.D.
students, many of whom are currently professors at a variety of universities.
He is now Professor Emeritus. Among many awards, in 1995 Professor Cali\'{n}ski
received the Order of Polonia Restituta for his outstanding achievements in the
fields of Education and Science. In 2012 the Polish Statistical Society awarded
him The Jerzy Sp{\l}awa-Neyman Medal for his contribution to the development of
research in statistics in Poland. Professor Cali\'{n}ski in addition has
Doctoral Degrees honoris causa from the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}
and the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. His research interests include
mathematical statistics and biometry, with applications to agriculture, natural
sciences, biology and genetics. He has published over 140 articles in
scientific journals as well as, with Sanpei Kageyama, two important books on
the randomization approach to the design and analysis of experiments. He has
been extremely active and successful in initiating and contributing to fruitful
international research cooperation between Polish statisticians and
biometricians and their colleagues in various countries, particularly in the
Netherlands, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Portugal. The
conversations in addition cover the history of biometry and experimental design
in Poland and the early influence of British statisticians.

Young supernova remnants that contain pulsar wind nebulae provide diagnostics
for both the inner part of the supernova and the interaction with the
surrounding medium, providing an opportunity to relate these objects to
supernova types. Among observed young nebulae, there is evidence for a range of
supernova types, including Type IIP (Crab Nebula and SN 1054) and Type
IIb/IIn/IIL (G292.0+1.8).

faking online posts for robberies, gunshots, and other dangerous incidents,
faking fitness activities with supernatural speeds and distances among many
others. Lastly, we discuss easy to implement and deploy mitigation strategies
which can greatly reduce the IIV attack surface and argue for their use as a
necessary complementary measure working toward trustworthy mobile crowdsourcing
services.

Despite millions of war widows worldwide, little is known about the economic
consequences of being widowed by war. We use life history data from West
Germany to show that war widowhood increased women's employment immediately
after World War II but led to lower employment rates later in life. War widows,
therefore, carried a double burden of employment and childcare while their
children were young but left the workforce when their children reached
adulthood. We show that the design of compensation policies likely explains
this counterintuitive life-cycle pattern and examine potential spillovers to
the next generation.

Intrinsic image decomposition (IID) is an under-constrained problem.
Therefore, traditional approaches use hand crafted priors to constrain the
problem. However, these constraints are limited when coping with complex
scenes. Deep learning-based approaches learn these constraints implicitly
through the data, but they often suffer from dataset biases (due to not being
able to include all possible imaging conditions).
  In this paper, a combination of the two is proposed. Component specific
priors like semantics and invariant features are exploited to obtain
semantically and physically plausible reflectance transitions. These
transitions are used to steer a progressive CNN with implicit homogeneity
constraints to decompose reflectance and shading maps.
  An ablation study is conducted showing that the use of the proposed priors
and progressive CNN increase the IID performance. State of the art performance
on both our proposed dataset and the standard real-world IIW dataset shows the
effectiveness of the proposed method. Code is made available at

Type IIP supernovae (SNe IIP), which represent the most common class of
core-collapse (CC) SNe, show a rapid increase in continuum polarization just
after entering the tail phase. This feature can be explained by a highly
asymmetric helium core, which is exposed when the hydrogen envelope becomes
transparent. Here we report the case of a SN IIP (SN~2017gmr) that shows an
unusually early rise of the polarization, $\gtrsim 30$ days before the start of
the tail phase. This implies that SN~2017gmr is an SN IIP that has very
extended asphericity. The asymmetries are not confined to the helium core, but
reach out to a significant part of the outer hydrogen envelope, hence clearly
indicating a marked intrinsic diversity in the aspherical structure of CC
explosions. These observations provide new constraints on the explosion
mechanism, where viable models must be able to produce such extended deviations
from spherical symmetry, and account for the observed geometrical diversity.

The first half of the 17th century was a time of intellectual ferment when
wars of natural philosophy were echoes of religious wars, as we illustrate by a
case study of an apparently innocuous mathematical technique called adequality
pioneered by the honorable judge Pierre de Fermat, its relation to
indivisibles, as well as to other hocus-pocus. Andre Weil noted that simple
applications of adequality involving polynomials can be treated purely
algebraically but more general problems like the cycloid curve cannot be so
treated and involve additional tools--leading the mathematician Fermat
potentially into troubled waters. Breger attacks Tannery for tampering with
Fermat's manuscript but it is Breger who tampers with Fermat's procedure by
moving all terms to the left-hand side so as to accord better with Breger's own
interpretation emphasizing the double root idea. We provide modern proxies for
Fermat's procedures in terms of relations of infinite proximity as well as the
standard part function.

Several Type IIb supernovae (SNe IIb) have been extensively studied, both in
terms of the progenitor radius and the mass-loss rate in the final centuries
before the explosion. While the sample is still limited, evidence has been
accumulating that the final mass-loss rate tends to be larger for a more
extended progenitor, with the difference exceeding an order of magnitude
between the more and less extended progenitors. The high mass-loss rates
inferred for the more extended progenitors are not readily explained by a
prescription commonly used for a single stellar wind. In this paper, we
calculate a grid of binary evolution models. We show that the observational
relation in the progenitor radii and mass-loss rates may be a consequence of
non-conservative mass transfer in the final phase of progenitor evolution
without fine tuning. Further, we find a possible link between SNe IIb and SNe
IIn. The binary scenario for SNe IIb inevitably leads to a population of SN
progenitors surrounded by dense circumstellar matter (CSM) due to extensive
mass loss ($\dot{M} \gtrsim 10^{-4} M_{\odot} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$) in the binary
origin. About 4% of all observed SNe IIn are predicted to have dense CSM,
produced by binary non-conservative mass transfer, whose observed
characteristics are distinguishable from SNe IIn from other scenarios. Indeed,
such SNe may be observationally dominated by systems experiencing huge mass
loss in the final $10^3$ yr, leading to luminous SNe IIn or initially bright
SNe IIP or IIL with characteristics of SNe IIn in their early spectra.

Mediation analysis is appealing for its ability to improve understanding of
the mechanistic drivers of causal effects, but real-world data complexities
challenge its successful implementation, including: 1) the existence of
post-exposure variables that also affect mediators and outcomes (thus,
confounding the mediator-outcome relationship), that may also be 2)
multivariate, and 3) the existence of multivariate mediators. Interventional
direct and indirect effects (IDE/IIE) accommodate post-exposure variables that
confound the mediator-outcome relationship, but currently, no estimator for
IDE/IIE exists that allows for both multivariate mediators and multivariate
post-exposure intermediate confounders. This, again, represents a significant
limitation for real-world analyses. We address this gap by extending two
recently developed nonparametric estimators -- one that estimates the IDE/IIE
and another that estimates the IDE/IIE transported to a new, target population
-- to allow for multivariate mediators and multivariate intermediate
confounders simultaneously. We use simulation to examine finite sample
performance, and apply these estimators to longitudinal data from the Moving to
Opportunity trial. In the application, we walk through a strategy for
separating indirect effects into mediator- or mediator-group-specific indirect
effects, while appropriately accounting for other, possibly co-occurring
intermediate variables.

We show that the diversity in the density slope of the dense wind due to
non-steady mass loss can be one way to explain the spectral diversity of Type
II luminous supernovae (LSNe). The interaction of SN ejecta and wind
surrounding it is considered to be a power source to illuminate LSNe because
many LSNe show the wind signature in their spectra (Type IIn LSNe). However,
there also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type
IIL LSNe). We show that, even if LSNe are illuminated by the interaction, it is
possible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into
account of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout
takes place in the dense wind with the density structure \rho\propto r^{-w},
the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind
(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock
breakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w<~1, both timescales are
comparable (td/ts \simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the
case td/ts\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light
curve (LC) peak and narrow spectral lines from the wind cannot be observed
after the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave
continues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains
(Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful
treatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow
Lorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be
explained by the difference in the density slope. Furthermore, we apply our
model to Type IIn LSN 2006gy and Type IIL LSN 2008es and find that our model is
consistent with the observations.

I explore a phenomenon of the circumstellar H alpha and H beta absorption
lines in the spectrum of luminous type IIL SN 2008fq taken on day 6.8 after the
discovery. The absorpion is identified with the radiatively accelerated
preshock wind up to ~800 km/s. The required initial luminosity is attributed to
the earlier circumstellar interaction with the confined dense shell of ~0.08
Msun. The modelling of similar luminous type IIL SN 1998S based on the same
approach results in the comparable shell mass of ~0.1 Msun. More than 1 dex
larger mass of the confined dense shell of both SNe IIL compared to that of
type IIP supernovae is attributed to the larger progenitor mass of type IIL
supernovae.

Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms
remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced
an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based
on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI
involving complex geometries. The ability of the method to sharply resolve
stress discontinuities induced by singular immersed boundary forces in the
presence of low-regularity geometrical representations makes it a compelling
choice for three-dimensional modeling of complex geometries in diverse
engineering applications. Although the IIM we previously introduced offers many
desirable advantages, it also imposes a restrictive mesh factor ratio,
requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure
stability. This is because when the mesh factor ratio constraint is not
satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI
system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs,
particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly
localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we
devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired
by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized
velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of
structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering
the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of
the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic
conditions, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution.

Tadeusz Cali\'{n}ski was born in Pozna\'{n}, Poland in 1928. Despite the
absence of formal secondary eduction for Poles during the Second World War, he
entered the University of Pozna\'{n} in 1948, initially studying agronomy and
in later years mathematics. From 1953 to 1988 he taught statistics, biometry
and experimental design at the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}. During
this period he founded and developed the Pozna\'{n} inter-university school of
mathematical statistics and biometry, which has become one of the most
important schools of this type in Poland and beyond. He has supervised 24 Ph.D.
students, many of whom are currently professors at a variety of universities.
He is now Professor Emeritus. Among many awards, in 1995 Professor Cali\'{n}ski
received the Order of Polonia Restituta for his outstanding achievements in the
fields of Education and Science. In 2012 the Polish Statistical Society awarded
him The Jerzy Sp{\l}awa-Neyman Medal for his contribution to the development of
research in statistics in Poland. Professor Cali\'{n}ski in addition has
Doctoral Degrees honoris causa from the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}
and the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. His research interests include
mathematical statistics and biometry, with applications to agriculture, natural
sciences, biology and genetics. He has published over 140 articles in
scientific journals as well as, with Sanpei Kageyama, two important books on
the randomization approach to the design and analysis of experiments. He has
been extremely active and successful in initiating and contributing to fruitful
international research cooperation between Polish statisticians and
biometricians and their colleagues in various countries, particularly in the
Netherlands, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Portugal. The

Young supernova remnants that contain pulsar wind nebulae provide diagnostics
for both the inner part of the supernova and the interaction with the
surrounding medium, providing an opportunity to relate these objects to
supernova types. Among observed young nebulae, there is evidence for a range of
supernova types, including Type IIP (Crab Nebula and SN 1054) and Type
IIb/IIn/IIL (G292.0+1.8).

This chapter reviews evidence for the evolution of primate asymmetries in brain morphology and in behaviour, including the fossil and archaeological record of human evolution. This evidence suggests that, while morphological asymmetries are conserved features of the human brain, human functional asymmetries are derived, at least in their degree and consistency. The discussion offers a partial explanation that takes account of allometric scaling in the evolution of brain size, neocortex size, and intra- and interhemispheric connectivity.

Improper Input Validation (IIV) is a software vulnerability that occurs when
a system does not safely handle input data. Even though IIV is easy to detect
and fix, it still commonly happens in practice. In this paper, we study to what
extent developers can detect IIV and investigate underlying reasons. This
knowledge is essential to better understand how to support developers in
creating secure software systems. We conduct an online experiment with 146
participants, of which 105 report at least three years of professional software
development experience. Our results show that the existence of a visible attack
scenario facilitates the detection of IIV vulnerabilities and that a
significant portion of developers who did not find the vulnerability initially
could identify it when warned about its existence. Yet, a total of 60
participants could not detect the vulnerability even after the warning. Other
factors, such as the frequency with which the participants perform code
reviews, influence the detection of IIV. Data and materials:

We correct what amounts to a sign error in the proof of part (i.) of theorem
3 in Class.Quant.Grav.28 225003 (arXiv:1107.0709). The Plebanski sectors
isolated by the linear simplicity constraints do not change --- they are still
the three sectors (deg), (II+), and (II-). What changes is the characterization
of the continuum Plebanski two-form corresponding to the first two terms in the
asymptotics of the EPRL vertex amplitude for Regge-like boundary data. These
two terms do not correspond to Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), but rather to
the two possible signs of the product of the sign of the sector --- +1 for
(II+) and -1 for (II-) --- and the sign of the orientation
$\epsilon_{IJKL}B^{IJ} \wedge B^{KL}$ determined by $B^{IJ}$. This is
consistent with what one would expect, as this is exactly the sign which
classically relates the BF action, in Plebanski sectors (II+) and (II-), to the
Einstein-Hilbert action, whose discretization is the Regge action appearing in
the asymptotics.

Intrinsic image decomposition is a challenging, long-standing computer vision
problem for which ground truth data is very difficult to acquire. We explore
the use of synthetic data for training CNN-based intrinsic image decomposition
models, then applying these learned models to real-world images. To that end,
we present \ICG, a new, large-scale dataset of physically-based rendered images
of scenes with full ground truth decompositions. The rendering process we use
is carefully designed to yield high-quality, realistic images, which we find to
be crucial for this problem domain. We also propose a new end-to-end training
method that learns better decompositions by leveraging \ICG, and optionally IIW
and SAW, two recent datasets of sparse annotations on real-world images.
Surprisingly, we find that a decomposition network trained solely on our
synthetic data outperforms the state-of-the-art on both IIW and SAW, and
performance improves even further when IIW and SAW data is added during
training. Our work demonstrates the suprising effectiveness of
carefully-rendered synthetic data for the intrinsic images task.

To determine whether or not H II starburst galaxies (H IIG) are
standardizable candles, we study the correlation between the H$\beta$
luminosity ($L$) and the velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) of the ionized gas from
H IIG measurements by simultaneously constraining the $L-\sigma$ relation
parameters and the cosmological model parameters. We investigate six flat and
nonflat relativistic dark energy cosmological models. We find that low-redshift
and high-redshift H IIG data subsets are standardizable but obey different
$L-\sigma$ relations. Current H IIG data are too sparse and too non-uniformly
distributed in redshift to allow for a determination of why the samples follow
different relations, but it could be caused by the high-redshift sample
containing relatively fewer intrinsically dimmer sources (Malmquist bias) or it
could be a consequence of H IIG evolution. Until this issue is better
understood, H IIG data cosmological constraints must be treated with caution.

The existing image steganography methods either sequentially conceal secret
images or conceal a concatenation of multiple images. In such ways, the
interference of information among multiple images will become increasingly
severe when the number of secret images becomes larger, thus restrict the
development of very large capacity image steganography. In this paper, we
propose an Invertible Mosaic Image Hiding Network (InvMIHNet) which realizes
very large capacity image steganography with high quality by concealing a
single mosaic secret image. InvMIHNet consists of an Invertible Image Rescaling
(IIR) module and an Invertible Image Hiding (IIH) module. The IIR module works
for downscaling the single mosaic secret image form by spatially splicing the
multiple secret images, and the IIH module then conceal this mosaic image under
the cover image. The proposed InvMIHNet successfully conceal and reveal up to
16 secret images with a small number of parameters and memory consumption.
Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO and DIV2K show InvMIHNet outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of both the imperceptibility of stego image
and recover accuracy of secret image.

We discuss four questions dealing with massive star evolution. The first one
is about the origin of slowly rotating, non-evolved, nitrogen rich stars. We
propose that these stars may originate from initially fast rotating stars whose
surface has been braked down. The second question is about the evolutionary
status of alpha-Cygni variables. According to their pulsation properties, these
stars should be post red supergiant stars. However, some stars at least present
surface abundances indicating that they should be pre red supergiant stars. How
to reconcile these two contradictory requirements? The third one concerns the
various supernova types which are the end point of the evolution of stars with
initial masses between 18 and 30 Msun, i.e. the most massive stars which go
through a red supergiant phase during their lifetime. Do they produce types
IIP, IIL, IIn, IIb or Ib supernovae or do they end without producing any SN
event? Finally, we shall discuss reasons why so few progenitors of type Ibc
supernovae have yet been detected?

We present early-time Swift and Chandra X-ray data along with late-time
optical and near-infrared observations of SN 2013by, a Type IIL supernova (SN)
that occurred in the nearby spiral galaxy ESO 138$-$G10 (D $\sim 14.8$ Mpc).
Optical and NIR photometry and spectroscopy follow the late-time evolution of
the supernova from days +89 to +457 post-maximum brightness. The optical
spectra and X-ray light curves are consistent with the picture of a SN having
prolonged interaction with circumstellar material (CSM) that accelerates the
transition from supernova to supernova remnant (SNR). Specifically, we find SN
2013by's H$\alpha$ profile exhibits significant broadening ($\sim$ 10,000 km
s$^{-1}$) on day +457, the likely consequence of high-velocity, H-rich material
being excited by a reverse shock. A relatively flat X-ray light curve is
observed that cannot be modeled using inverse-Compton scattering processes
alone but requires an additional energy source most likely originating from the
SN-CSM interaction. In addition, we see the first overtone of CO emission near
2.3 $\mu$m on day +152, signaling the formation of molecules and dust in the SN
ejecta and is the first time CO has been detected in a Type IIL supernova. We
compare SN 2013by to Type IIP supernovae whose spectra show the rarely observed
SN-to-SNR transition in varying degrees and conclude that Type IIL SNe may
enter the remnant phase at earlier epochs than their Type IIP counterparts.

In recent years, the quality and public interest in music generation systems
have grown, encouraging research into various ways to control these systems. We
propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using
sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous
Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived
musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be
calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of
surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in
irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose
IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that
the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The
correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for
estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if
human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when
generating the respective musical material. We provide code for creating IIC
interpolations and IIC visualizations on https://github.com/muthissar/iic.

Mobile crowdsourcing services (MCS), enable fast and economical data
acquisition at scale and find applications in a variety of domains. Prior work
has shown that Foursquare and Waze (a location-based and a navigation MCS) are
vulnerable to different kinds of data poisoning attacks. Such attacks can be
upsetting and even dangerous especially when they are used to inject improper
inputs to mislead users. However, to date, there is no comprehensive study on
the extent of improper input validation (IIV) vulnerabilities and the
feasibility of their exploits in MCSs across domains. In this work, we leverage
the fact that MCS interface with their participants through mobile apps to
design tools and new methodologies embodied in an end-to-end feedback-driven
analysis framework which we use to study 10 popular and previously unexplored
services in five different domains. Using our framework we send tens of
thousands of API requests with automatically generated input values to
characterize their IIV attack surface. Alarmingly, we found that most of them
(8/10) suffer from grave IIV vulnerabilities which allow an adversary to launch
data poisoning attacks at scale: 7400 spoofed API requests were successful in
faking online posts for robberies, gunshots, and other dangerous incidents,
faking fitness activities with supernatural speeds and distances among many
others. Lastly, we discuss easy to implement and deploy mitigation strategies
which can greatly reduce the IIV attack surface and argue for their use as a
necessary complementary measure working toward trustworthy mobile crowdsourcing
services.

We show that the diversity in the density slope of the dense wind due to

there also exist LSNe without the spectral features caused by the wind (Type

possible that they do not show the narrow spectra from the wind if we take into
account of non-steady mass loss of their progenitors. When the shock breakout
takes place in the dense wind with the density structure \rho\propto r^{-w},
the ratio of the diffusion timescale in the optically thick region of the wind
(td) and the shock propagation timescale of the entire wind after the shock
breakout (ts) strongly depends on w. For the case w<~1, both timescales are
comparable (td/ts \simeq 1) and td/ts gets smaller as w gets larger. For the
case td/ts\simeq 1, the shock goes through the entire wind just after the light

after the LC peak (Type IIL LSNe). If td/ts is much smaller, the shock wave
continues to propagate in the wind after the LC peak and unshocked wind remains
(Type IIn LSNe). This difference can be obtained only through a careful
treatment of the shock breakout condition in a dense wind. The lack of narrow
Lorentzian line profiles in Type IIL LSNe before the LC peak can also be
explained by the difference in the density slope. Furthermore, we apply our
model to Type IIn LSN 2006gy and Type IIL LSN 2008es and find that our model is
consistent with the observations.

I explore a phenomenon of the circumstellar H alpha and H beta absorption
lines in the spectrum of luminous type IIL SN 2008fq taken on day 6.8 after the

the earlier circumstellar interaction with the confined dense shell of ~0.08

larger mass of the confined dense shell of both SNe IIL compared to that of
type IIP supernovae is attributed to the larger progenitor mass of type IIL
supernovae.

Robust, broadly applicable fluid-structure interaction (FSI) algorithms
remain a challenge for computational mechanics. In previous work, we introduced
an immersed interface method (IIM) for discrete surfaces and an extension based
on an immersed Lagrangia-Eulerian (ILE) coupling strategy for modeling FSI

requiring the surface mesh to be coarser than the fluid grid to ensure

satisfied, parts of the structure motion are not controlled by the discrete FSI
system. This constraint can significantly increase computational costs,
particularly in applications involving multiscale geometries with highly
localized complexity or fine-scale features. To address this limitation, we
devise a stabilization strategy for the velocity restriction operator inspired
by Tikhonov regularization. This study demonstrates that using a stabilized
velocity restriction operator in IIM enables a broader range of
structure-to-fluid grid-size ratios without compromising accuracy or altering
the flow dynamics. This advancement significantly broadens the applicability of
the method to real-world FSI problems involving complex geometries and dynamic
conditions, offering a robust and computationally efficient solution.

Tadeusz Cali\'{n}ski was born in Pozna\'{n}, Poland in 1928. Despite the
absence of formal secondary eduction for Poles during the Second World War, he
entered the University of Pozna\'{n} in 1948, initially studying agronomy and
in later years mathematics. From 1953 to 1988 he taught statistics, biometry
and experimental design at the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}. During
this period he founded and developed the Pozna\'{n} inter-university school of
mathematical statistics and biometry, which has become one of the most
important schools of this type in Poland and beyond. He has supervised 24 Ph.D.
students, many of whom are currently professors at a variety of universities.
He is now Professor Emeritus. Among many awards, in 1995 Professor Cali\'{n}ski
received the Order of Polonia Restituta for his outstanding achievements in the
fields of Education and Science. In 2012 the Polish Statistical Society awarded
him The Jerzy Sp{\l}awa-Neyman Medal for his contribution to the development of
research in statistics in Poland. Professor Cali\'{n}ski in addition has
Doctoral Degrees honoris causa from the Agricultural University of Pozna\'{n}
and the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. His research interests include
mathematical statistics and biometry, with applications to agriculture, natural
sciences, biology and genetics. He has published over 140 articles in
scientific journals as well as, with Sanpei Kageyama, two important books on
the randomization approach to the design and analysis of experiments. He has
been extremely active and successful in initiating and contributing to fruitful
international research cooperation between Polish statisticians and
biometricians and their colleagues in various countries, particularly in the
Netherlands, France, Italy, Great Britain, Germany, Japan and Portugal. The
conversations in addition cover the history of biometry and experimental design
in Poland and the early influence of British statisticians.

Young supernova remnants that contain pulsar wind nebulae provide diagnostics
for both the inner part of the supernova and the interaction with the
surrounding medium, providing an opportunity to relate these objects to
supernova types. Among observed young nebulae, there is evidence for a range of
supernova types, including Type IIP (Crab Nebula and SN 1054) and Type
IIb/IIn/IIL (G292.0+1.8).
